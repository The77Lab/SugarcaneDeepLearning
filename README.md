"Deep learning to do quality analysis of sugarcane"

Dataset with 3 sugarcane varieties to compare the precision and processing time of different CNN models.
The images of each variety are separated in images of damaged sugarcane billets or images of good sugarcane billets.
Each sugarcane billet was captured in high resolution images and they were segmented.

If you download or use this dataset you should cite the paper:
